The application aims to empower users' privacy rights by streamlining GDPR (General Data Protection Regulation) and CCPA (California Consumer Privacy Act) compliance requests.

    User-Friendly Interface: Simply input your personal information into the program, and it will handle the rest.

Usage:

    Data Broker List Preparation: Before using the application, ensure to clear the lists of US and EU Data Brokers if you wish to add new Data Brokers.
    Opt-Out Process: After sending out requests, you might need to respond to follow-up emails or complete online requests on certain websites to finalize data deletion. This process can vary from a few seconds to several months.
    Responsible Use: Please use this program responsibly. Avoid abusing the system or spamming Data Brokers, as this could degrade service quality for everyone.
